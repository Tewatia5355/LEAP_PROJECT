## Problem Statement

##### Few Problems from the perspective of travelers

- Too many programs and they are not interoperable
- Management of the accounts and the rules on earning loyalty points are not clear

##### Few Problems from the perspective of partners

- The decreasing rate of redemption in loyalty programs,
- Tedious partner onboarding process,
- Loyalty program reconciliation currently happens periodically, and it may be time consuming
 

<a name="proposedSolution"></a>
## Proposed Solution
The platform has 2 sides of it:
- **One for the Consumer** ‚Äì through mobile / API frontend. Providing them the ability to check the loyalty points accrued from various travels and providers. And also, being able to redeem them
- **One for the Partners** ‚Äì be it the loyalty program owners like airlines, hotels, etc, or the partners where the points can be redeemed.

This product in blockchain offers decentralized, traceable, immutable, and Transparent solutions. And doing it in the Hyperledger platform provides the enterprise edge to the blockchain solution.

## Solution Benefits

##### The minimum viable product would provide

**Traveler - the ability for**
- Creation of a traveler digital wallet to hold the points
- Earn Airline NFT ‚Äì view that in the wallet

**Partner side - the ability for**
- Airline
- Register as a partner into the platform
- Create NFT for the loyalty reward


<a name="solutionUq"></a>
## Solution Uniqueness

Currently, these are the reason the existing solutions are inadequate
- No open-source trustworthy real-time reconciliation process.
- No integrated platform that travelers can use to consolidate their travel loyalty points

## Roadmap/Next Steps

- Giving  the Leap Point not only on travel booking but also on other purchase to promote travel.
- Making an expiry date in the wallet balance. Most probably 3 months so that people are persuaded to travel.
- Giving more points to people using the leap wallet frequently as promotion to incentivize travel
